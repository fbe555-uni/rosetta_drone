Basically a control node. This gives you options when you run it. It will run the same thing on the drone and flightmare through dji_wrapper and flightmare_wrapper. Based on the selection of the user, it will publish to the common topics used.  
There are three launch files - the base launch file ui.launch launches the ui. Then flightmare_ui.launch and dji_ui.launch will call that launch file but put it in the correct namespace. We opted to have these different launch files to accommodate having different namespaces for different drones so in the future this structure will work better for having multi-agent systems since each can live in its own namespace.
